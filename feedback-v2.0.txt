9/10

- Good work and a lot of nice added test cases!

- It's not clear that you are handling overflow as designed. For example; if the wordsize is 8 and we try to add 250 + 250, what happens? Do we get overflow and a truncated number left on the stack?

- Your execute() function and the use of the operation factory is a nice way of getting an easily extensible system. You are limiting where modifications need to be made while still allowing flexibility.

- The code does not allow wordsizes that are not a multiple of 8
